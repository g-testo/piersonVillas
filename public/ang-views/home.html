    Located just north of downtown, the Harborwood/Encanto area stands as one of the earliest areas developed 
    as Phoenix grew into a major city. The central location and easy access to public buses, light rail and major 
    highways keep residents well connected. The diverse neighborhoods include a nationally recognized park, 
    restaurants and bars ranging from basic to upscale and busy business and shopping districts along Camelback 
    Road, Central Avenue and McDowell Road.
